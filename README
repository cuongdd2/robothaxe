To run the unit test suite in JS and AVM2 run the following from the command line:

% haxe test.hxml

View mediation has been extracted into an interface: robothaxe.core.IViewContainer. ViewMaps add callbacks for viewAdded and viewRemoved, which in Flash would map to ADDED_TO_STAGE and REMOVED_FROM_STAGE, and in JS could potentially use DOM mutation events. I'll make a simple cross platform proof of concept soon.

All tests are passing under AVM2/JS :)
